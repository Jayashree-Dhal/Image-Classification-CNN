## Business Problem
In sectors like Banking, Insurance, Governance, Medical and Legal, still deal with various handwritten notes and scanned documents. In later parts of the business life cycle, it becomes a very tedious job to maintain and classify these documents manually. A simple and meaningful automated binning of these unclassified documents would make it a lot easier to maintain and leverage the information and reduce the manual effort significantly.
## CNN
Convolutional Neural Network has great success for Image Classification., There exist large domain differences between natural images and document images. For example, in natural image , the object of interest can appear in any region of the image. In contrast, many document images are 2D entities that occupy the whole image. With CNN we can use it for natural image classification as well as document image classification.
